## Curve Optimizer 
Checking Curve Optimizer compatiblity is pretty easy. I will recommend you to use UXTU (Universal x86 tuning utility)
Curve Optimizer is AMD's undervolting technology, its available for the CPU and iGPU. There are multiple ways to check the current iGPU and CPU voltage, however I will tell you to use HWinfo64 for since its a all-in-one tool that makes everything easier. You can download HWinfo64 from [here.](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)

Once you download HWinfo64, you will only need the sensors. Choose Sensors-Only instead of "Full mode"
