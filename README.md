## Curve Optimizer 
Checking Curve Optimizer compatiblity is pretty easy. I will recommend you to use UXTU (Universal x86 tuning utility)
and HWinfo64, even though CPU-Z and GPU-Z can technically also get the job done.

Curve Optimizer is AMD's undervolting technology, its available for both the CPU and the iGPU. There are multiple ways to check the current iGPU and CPU voltage, however I will tell you to use HWinfo64 for since its a all-in-one tool that makes everything easier. You can download HWinfo64 from [here.](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)

Once you download HWinfo64, you will only need the sensors. Choose Sensors-Only instead of "Full mode"

Good! Once you click start, you should see something like this:

If you somehow dont see this, you managed to mess up at the easiest part.

So we have HWinfo now but you will also need UXTU, you can get it from over [here.](https://github.com/JamesCJ60/Universal-x86-Tuning-Utility/releases) you will be prompted to install some dependencies like PawnIO and Microsoft .net desktop runtime 10. If you struggle anywhere, you can join the discord server of this software [here](https://discord.gg/u8eEAMTzU4)
